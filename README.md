# Title-Phi-Action-Stability
Theoretical research on the breakdown of linear mass-lifetime scaling. Introducing the Phi (\Phi) action-density metric to evaluate particle stability. Analysis of the Standard Model identifies a catastrophic "Insolvency Signature" in heavy bosons, establishing a critical threshold for fundamental matter.
