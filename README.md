## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the revised preprint titled: **"Breakdown of Linear Mass-Lifetime Scaling and the Emergence of a Critical Action Threshold"**. 

This work introduces a novel non-linear metric, $\Phi$ (Action-Density), to evaluate the structural stability of fundamental particles. By performing a rigorous residual analysis of the Standard Model dataset, we demonstrate that the previously hypothesized linear scaling between mass and lifetime fails for high-mass entities. The paper identifies a profound **"Insolvency Signature"** in heavy bosons, suggesting a non-linear phase collapse of fundamental stability at a specific action threshold ($\Phi_c$).

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. The $\Phi$ Metric
The core of this research is the definition of the Action-Density parameter:
$$\Phi = \log_{10} \left( \frac{m \cdot \tau}{\hbar} \right)$$
where $m$ is the invariant mass, $\tau$ is the mean lifetime, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

### 2. Breakdown of Universality
The research proves that while light, stable particles (Protons, Electrons) follow a predictable solvency baseline, heavy force carriers like the $W^{\pm}$ and $H^0$ bosons exhibit catastrophic logarithmic residuals ($R < -45$), signaling a transition from "solvent" matter to "insolvent" structural decay.

### 3. Residual Analysis
Instead of seeking a single universal correlation, this work focuses on the **Residual Field structure**, identifying the specific points where the microphysical action-field undergoes a phase transition.

## 📊 Major Findings

- **Insolvency Signature:** Quantified evidence of stability collapse in the $W^{\pm}$ and $H^0$ bosons.
- **Critical Threshold ($\Phi_c$):** Identification of the limit beyond which linear scaling is superseded by structural insolvency.
- **Stability Baseline:** Establishment of the "Solvency Rung" for long-lived fundamental matter.

## 📝 Abstract

This paper presents a critical refinement of the action-density metric $\Phi$. By analyzing the Standard Model dataset, we demonstrate that the previously hypothesized linear mass-lifetime scaling fails to account for the stability of high-mass entities. Through a rigorous residual analysis, we identify a profound "Insolvency Signature" in heavy bosons, which exhibit negative residuals exceeding 45 orders of magnitude relative to the stability baseline of light particles. This work establishes the $\Phi$ metric as a robust indicator of structural action-solvency and defines a critical threshold ($\Phi_c$) beyond which fundamental stability undergoes a non-linear phase collapse.

## ⚖️ License & Originality

This work is an original development. While it builds upon foundational concepts of scale-invariance and topological stability, the $\Phi$ formalism and the specific identification of the "Insolvency Signature" are unique contributions introduced by this research.
